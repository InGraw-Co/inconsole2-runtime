## Quick Start-up
The recommended build environment is **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (WSL)** – this setup was used for testing.  
A native Linux installation should also work, however **x86_64 is strongly recommended**.

Other architectures (e.g. ARM) are not guaranteed to work out of the box and may require manual library adjustments.

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install rsync wget unzip build-essential git bc swig libncurses-dev libpython3-dev libssl-dev python3-distutils android-tools-mkbootimg

## About Buildroot
```
Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
You can also find us on #buildroot on Freenode IRC.
